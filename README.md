GAlexa: Developing Explanatory Tools for Probabilistic Graphical Models

GAlexa seeks to develop Natural Language Generation (NLG) tools for explaining the outputs of decision analytic methods such as probabilistic graphical models and Bayesian Belief Networks. 

The GAlexa demo is a simple proof-of-concept prototype that uses the Netica-J API to interrogate Bayesian networks in order to convey and explain the results of probabilistic inferences based on input queries.
