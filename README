GAlexa 

The following files and directories describe the different code parts of GAlexa:

GAlexa/
  |
  +-- src/
  |     Java sources in here.
  +-- lib/
  |     any external files used by your plugin (e.g. Netica-J jars could go here)
  |    
  +-- build.xml
  |     Ant build file for building and running the java classes and jar.
  +-- build
  |     java classes and jar in corresponding subdirectories
  |   
  +-- Data 
  |	data files for input and output can be found here

To build the system you can use Ant:

ant main

This will compile the Java code, package the classes into a JAR file and run it with the 
command line arguments specified in build.xml.  Please have a look in build.xml to see how you can modify the paths or other arguments for your own task.

Important notes:
================

(1) GAlexa makes use of the Netica-J API but that is not distributed together with GAlexa here. Please make sure you download ir from the Norsys website. 

The version used for this build is NeticaJ_504 which comes in 32-bit. For this reason, you will need to use a 32-bit JVM and set the JAVA_HOME path appropriately (the version used for the jar was "1.8.0_261").

(2) GAlexa is currently a very early prototype and the exemplary questions are provided in a structured form of a predicate with a single subject and multiple objects (implemented currently in XML). The structure of the file Data/questions.xml is simple enough to understand the type of questions it can answer. Please note that the node names and attributes are case-sensitive and must correspond exactly to those found in the Bayes net. The system currently does not have elaborate functionalities for handling misspellings etc.
